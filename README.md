## Hi, I'm Max Bueckert ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. My experience and interests are diverse, ranging from Full Stack Web and Mobile Development to developing advanced image processing algorithms in C++.

For web and mobile projects, my go-to stack includes React and React Native for the front end. For comprehensive projects, I leverage AWS Amplify for robust backend solutions. Alternatively, for rapid prototyping, such as in hackathons, I prefer setting up a lightweight backend with a Flask Python server.
